The following 7 files contain the program systems
ENLSIP (for constrained nonlinear least squares)

These files can be downloaded using some browser at URL-address
ftp://ftp.cs.umu.se/pub/users/perl/ENLSIP.tar.gz
This file should be unpacked by
gunzip ENLSIP.tar.gz
tar -xf ENLSIP.tar
That should give you a directory ENLSIP with the files below included.

The systems are described in a user's guide UMINF-109/110.84
by Per Lindstroem, Institute of Information Processing,
University of Umea, Sweden.
The software is now written in double precision but the documentation
has not been updated since the single precision version. The software
has also been developed a great deal so there might be some trace
printings that should be taken away.
More details can be found in
Wedin, Lindstroem: Methods and Software for Nonlinear Least
Squares Problems, UMINF-133.87 (rev. July 1988, 1993) and in "Gauss-Newton
based algorithms for constrained least squares problems" of which the last
one can be downloaded from
http://www.cs.umu.se/~perl/reports/alg.ps.gz
